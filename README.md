# Mazespin

### Objective
@Mazespinbot is a twitter account that whenever tagged/mentioned will reply with how long it has been since Mazepin last spin.

### How?
The code is written in Python.
Firstly, using "Selenium" module, the time of the last spin is taken from https://mazesp.in/, and saved in a program variable
Then using the twitter API we look for the bot mentions that were not yet handeled and reply with the time.

To promote the bot the program also comments on all the @f1 and @wtf1 tweets.

### Why?
The bot creators are both enthusiastic by F1 and programming so it was a fun project they decided to create.
It improved web-scrapping and API usage.
